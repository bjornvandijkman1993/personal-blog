Hi, my name is Björn, and welcome to this blog where I write about various data engineering topics. I really enjoy the technical  aspects of my job, but I am also passionate about writing 📝 and teaching 👨‍🏫, which is why I created this blog. I hope that you will find the content on this blog useful.
